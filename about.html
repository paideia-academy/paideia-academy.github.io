            <h3>A QUALITY CHRISTIAN EDUCATION WITH VALUES YOU CAN TRUST!</h3>

<p>Excellent programs, computer programing, STEM, and college prep academics are not the only reasons student come to Paideia Academy. This is a place where kids blossom into all that God intends for them to become. Our K to 8th grade staff is committed to developing Christian character that will impact and shape your child’s life.</p><br><br>


<h3>Curriculum</h3>
<p>We select the best curriculum available for the subject, then test annually to ensure a high level of understanding. We assess students where they are academically; then teach and train them to work independently and to be the best possible person that they can be. In order to adequately prepare students, we use textbooks and materials that develop both mind and heart. Our curriculum exceeds the California Educational Standards.</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>
<p>Our coding program is taught by a software engineer, and teaches kids the fundamentals of computer programming, how to become a problem solver. The skills that come with computer programming help kids develop new ways of thinking and foster problem-solving techniques that can have big repercussions in other areas. Computational thinking allows students to grasp concepts like algorithms, and recursion—even if they don’t understand the terms, they’ll learn the basic concepts.</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>Students attending Paideia Academy have time to complete all work during regular school hours. This is possible because students work very efficiently during the school day. As work is completed the students immediately moves on to the assignment for the next course. Students are taught to work independently, to read assigned material and to seek clarification from the teaching staff as needed. Thus, teaching is individually tailored to the needs of each student.</p>

<h3>School Hours</h3>
<p>One of the advantages of Paideia is that your children will be provided with full instructional days. School begins at 8:30 am each day and ends at 3:30 pm</p>

<h3>Come and visit us</h3>
